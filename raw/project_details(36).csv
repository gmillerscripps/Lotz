"##Project Description=Basic Details: 	  Sample Submission ID	123_1628  User	Kawata Manabu  Lab	Lotz  Account Code	(08)RAG049617B(C3-554316)-100.00%  Fee	0.00 USD  Discount	0.00%  Actual Fee	  Quoted Amount	  Expected Date	  Actual Date	  Service Id	 	 	 Project Information:	 Study title	Lotz_06222021_MK Sample Type description (e.g. Jurkat cell line: liver tissue)	TC28a2 chondrocyte cell line Species	Human 	 Services:	 Please briefly describe what you would like the Genomics Core to do for you	ChIP-seq 	 Samples:	 Number of Samples submitted	5 How many reads per sample are needed?	80 million reads How many reads total for all samples are needed?	400 million reads 	 Additional Information:	 Would you like Genomics Core to prepare your sequencing libraries?	No Did you use a commercial kit? If so which kit (please specify).	ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Kit + DNA Unique Dual Index Kit Did you use a non-commercial kit? we will need details of the library construct and barcode formats - please contact Genomics Core for assistance)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	To identify genes that are regulated by KLF4 in the TC28a2 human chondrocyte cell line. We transfected TC28a2 cells with HA-KLF4 expression vectors: and did ChIP using anti HA-tag antibody. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	ChIP-seq analysis with bed files and bar files as output. I would like to discuss the details of data analyses with Padma. Examples of the analyses to be done by us are as follows:	 1) GREAT GO analysis (GREAT Input: Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool: Bejerano Lab: Stanford University) 	 2) Motif analysis using MEME-ChIP (http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme-chip)	 3) Peak analysis using the cisgenome browser	 References to closely related work (optional)	I would like to do analysis in the similar way described in my previous work (PMID: 31402337). 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7"
