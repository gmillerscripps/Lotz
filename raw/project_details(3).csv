Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	We have the kit in our lab and will provide this to you. 	 Data Analysis Service Options from the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB):	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	No The CCBB can provide pathway analysis (for bulk or single cell gene expression datasets) for a small service fee. Contact CCBB@scripps.edu for more details. Please check all boxes that apply.	 - Advaita Pathway Analysis ($25 per a set of up to 5 comparisons) - human/mouse/rat	FALSE - GSEA ($50 per comparison per gene-set of your choice at http://www.gseamsigbd.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp) - human only	FALSE No pathway analysis service needed at this time	FALSE Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	 We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	 Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	 References to closely related work (optional)	 	 Experimental Variables:	 To assist with data analysis: please provide a complete list of experimental variables that apply to your samples.
