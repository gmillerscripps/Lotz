Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 	 Data Analysis Service Options from the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB):	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes The CCBB can provide pathway analysis (for bulk or single cell gene expression datasets) for a small service fee. Contact CCBB@scripps.edu for more details. Please check all boxes that apply.	 - Advaita Pathway Analysis ($25 per a set of up to 5 comparisons) - human/mouse/rat	TRUE - GSEA ($50 per comparison per gene-set of your choice at http://www.gseamsigbd.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp) - human only	FALSE No pathway analysis service needed at this time	FALSE Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files? fastq files	 We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	The goal is to elucidate differences of regulation beween mocetinostat and panobinostat. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	JC-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as output.  Because variations of basal expression levels between donors are large: please perform with paired DESeq2 analysis.	 The analyses to be done are as follows:	 1) Moc vs DMSO	 2) Pano40 vs DMSO	 3) Pano160 vs DMSO	 4) Pano40 vs Moc	 5) Pano160 vs Moc	 6) Pano160 vs Pano40	 7) Moc_IL1b vs DMSO_IL1b	 8) Pano40_IL1b vs DMSO_IL1b	 9) Pano160_IL1b vs DMSO_IL1b	 10) Pano40_IL1b vs Moc_IL1b	 11) Pano160_IL1b vs Moc_IL1b	 12) Pano160_IL1b vs Pano40_IL1b	 References to closely related work (optional)	 	 Experimental Variables:	 To assist with data analysis: please provide a complete list of experimental variables that apply to your samples. These variable will be used to categorize your samples for statistical comparison.	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7"
