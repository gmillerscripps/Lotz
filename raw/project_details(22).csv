Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	There are 4 different experiments. Experiment #1) Ad-KLF4 treatment with/without IL1b in human chondrocytes (experiment #1 samples 1 to 32)	 Experiment #2) Mocetinostat treatment in TC28 cells (samples 33 to 40)	 Experiment #3) Mocetinostat treatment with/without IL1b in human chondrocytes (samples 41 to 64)	 Experiment #4) IL1b treatment of human chondrocytes (samples 65 to 76)	 Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	DURG-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as output.  The analyses to be done are as follows:	 Experiment #1	 1-1) Ad-KLF4_IL(-) vs Ad-EGFP_IL(-)	 1-2) Ad-KLF4_IL(+) vs Ad-EGFP_IL(+)	 1-3) Ad-EGFP_IL(+) vs Ad-EGFP_IL(-)	 	 Experiment #2	 2-1) TC_Tx vs TC_DMSO	 	 Experiment #3	 3-1) Chon_Tx_IL(-) vs Chon_DMSO_IL(-)	 3-2) Chon_Tx_IL(+) vs Chon_DMSO_IL(+)	 3-3) Chon_DMSO_IL(+) vs Chon_DMSO_IL(-)	 	 Experiment #4	 4-1) Chondrocyte_IL1b vs Chondrocyte_Con	 References to closely related work (optional)	PMID: 35534137 (our recent work with you) Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	fastq files 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7"
