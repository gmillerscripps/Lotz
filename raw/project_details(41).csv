Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	To identify genes that are differentially regulated by KLF2 and KLF4 in human chondrocytes. We want to do some more analyses by using the samples without adenovirus as controls. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	DURG-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as output.  The analyses to be done are as follows:	 1) Ad-EGFP without IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 2) Ad-KLF2 without IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 3) Ad-KLF4 without IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 4) Ad-EGFP with IL1b vs No-Ad with IL1b	 5) Ad-KLF2 with IL1b vs No-Ad with IL1b	 6) Ad-KLF4 with IL1b vs No-Ad with IL1b	 7) No-Ad with IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 References to closely related work (optional)	Derived from the same experiments of Lotz_12142020_MK 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7	 	 Service Items:	 DrugSeq	 number of samples	11 Price	10 Total	110"
