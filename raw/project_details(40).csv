Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	To identify genes that are differentially regulated by KLF2 and KLF4 in TC28 cells. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	DURG-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as output.  The analyses to be done are as follows:	 1) Ad-EGFP without IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 2) Ad-KLF2 without IL1b vs Ad-EGFP without IL1b	 3) Ad-KLF4 without IL1b vs Ad-EGFP without IL1b	 4) Ad-KLF4 without IL1b vs Ad-KLF2 without IL1	 5) Ad-EGFP with IL1b vs No-Ad with IL1b	 6) Ad-KLF2 with IL1b vs Ad-EGFP with IL1b	 7) Ad-KLF4 with IL1b vs Ad-EGFP with IL1b	 8) Ad-KLF4 with IL1b vs Ad-KLF2 with IL1	 9) No-Ad with IL1b vs No-Ad without IL1b	 10) Ad-EGFP with IL1b vs Ad-EGFP without IL1b	 References to closely related work (optional)	 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7	 	 Service Items:	 DrugSeq	 number of samples	56 Price	10 Total	560 	 Milestone:	 Date Created	4/6/2021 15:23 Date Ended	 Submitted By	Kay Sheila Milestone	Sample Received Total Price	0 Comments"
