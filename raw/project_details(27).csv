"##Project Description=Basic Details: 	  Sample Submission ID	126_4339  User	Kawata Manabu  Lab	Lotz  Account Code	(08)RAG049617B(C3-554316)-100.00%  Fee	0.00 USD  Discount	0.00%  Actual Fee	  Quoted Amount	  Expected Date	  Actual Date	  Service Id	 	 	 Project Information:	 Study title	Lotz_0110-2022_MK Sample Type description (e.g. Jurkat cell line: liver tissue)	TC28a2 cells Species	Human 	 Services:	 Please briefly describe what you would like the Genomics Core to do for you	Sequencing of ChIP samples with a P2 100 cycle flowcell 	 Samples:	 Number of Samples submitted	2 How many reads per sample are needed?	80M reads per sample How many reads total for all samples are needed?	160M reads 	 Additional Information:	 Would you like Genomics Core to prepare your sequencing libraries?	No Did you use a commercial kit? If so which kit (please specify).	ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Kit Did you use a non-commercial kit? we will need details of the library construct and barcode formats - please contact Genomics Core for assistance)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	As an additional control ChIP sample of Lotz_06222021_MK: we transfected TC28a2 cells with an empty vector: and did ChIP using anti HA-tag antibody. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	ChIP-seq analysis with bed files and bigWig files as output. I would like to do analysis in the same way as the original samples in Lotz_06222021_MK. References to closely related work (optional)	 Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	Yes 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7	 	 	 Sample 1	 Sample Number (integer 1 - N)	1 Meaningful Unique Sample Name	Empty_HA-ChIP i7 Index	GCTTGTCA i5 Index	GAACATAC Forward in-line barcode	 Reverse in-line barcode	 Comments	U6 of DNA Unique Dual Index Kit â€“ 24U Set A Sample Name Code (to be completed by CCBB)	 Variable 1 (value)	 Variable 2 (value)	 Variable 3 (value)	 Variable 4 (value)	 Variable 5 (value)	 Variable 6 (value)	 Variable 7 (value)	 	 Sample 2	 Sample Number (integer 1 - N)	2 Meaningful Unique Sample Name	Empty_Input i7 Index	ATCCACTG i5 Index	AGGTGCGT Forward in-line barcode	 Reverse in-line barcode	 Comments	U5 of DNA Unique Dual Index Kit â€“ 24U Set A Sample Name Code (to be completed by CCBB)	 Variable 1 (value)	 Variable 2 (value)	 Variable 3 (value)	 Variable 4 (value)	 Variable 5 (value)	 Variable 6 (value)	 Variable 7 (value)"
