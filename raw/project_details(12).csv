Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	Human TC28 cells were treated with DMSO as control: 2 uM mocetinostat: or 40 nM or 160 nM panobinostat (n5). The goal is to elucidate differences of regulation beween mocetinostat and panobinostat. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	JC-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as output.  The analyses to be done are as follows:	 1) Moc2uM vs DMSO	 2) Pano40nM vs DMSO	 3) Pano160nM vs DMSO	 4) Pano40nM vs Moc2uM	 5) Pano160nM vs Moc2uM	 6) Pano160nM vs Pano40nM	 References to closely related work (optional)	 Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	Yes 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	 Variable 2	 Variable 3	 Variable 4	 Variable 5	 Variable 6	 Variable 7"
