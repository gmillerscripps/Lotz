Species	Human 	 Services:	 Please briefly describe what you would like the Genomics Core to do for you	RNA seq (JC seq) 	 Samples:	 Number of Samples submitted	72 How many reads per sample are needed?	5:000:000 How many reads total for all samples are needed?	 	 Additional Information:	 Would you like Genomics Core to prepare your sequencing libraries?	Yes Which kit? (if not sure: Genomics Core will provide this information)	 Would you like the CCBB to provide data analysis?	Yes We highly recommend completing this section in anticipation of future GEO submissions	 Goal of the Project	Human AF & NP cells were treated with DMSO as a control and varying concentrations of cyproheptadine & mocetinostat. The goal is to find regulatory differences. Details of requested bioinformatics analyses	JC-seq analysis with differentially expressed genes as output. The analyses are to be done against DMSO. IE: 30uM Cyproheptadine VS DMSO	 References to closely related work (optional)	 Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	fastq 	 Experimental Variables:	 Variable 1	Media Control (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 2	DMSO Control (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 3	30nM Cyproheptadine (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 4	50nM Cyproheptadine (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 5	10nM Mocetinostat (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 6	30nM Mocetinostat (6 samples in duplicate) Variable 7"
"##Analysis Notes=Would you prefer to receive a bcl files and/or a fastq files?	fastq This is Kevin Myers project, he was having trouble with Elan so Marissa submitted the request for him. Please send data to kmyers@scripps.edu."
